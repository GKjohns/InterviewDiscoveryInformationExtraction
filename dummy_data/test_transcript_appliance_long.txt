## Transcript

Sarah: Thank you all for joining our focus group today about the SingingSous™, the world's first AI kitchen assistant that communicates through musical numbers. Professor Whimsy, as our resident expert in musical kitchen technology, would you like to start by sharing your initial impressions?

Professor Whimsy: *adjusting bow tie* Well, I must say, when my toaster first performed a rendition of "Hot Cross Buns" at precisely 7:23 AM last Tuesday, I was thoroughly impressed. Though I do wish it hadn't attempted to harmonize with my coffee maker's interpretation of "Steam Heat."

Luna: *laughing* That's nothing! Mine did an entire Broadway-style number called "Your Soufflé Is Falling" complete with jazz hands made of light projections. I've never run to my oven so fast!

Dev: Wait, yours does jazz hands? Mine just spins its temperature dial dramatically while singing "Turning Up The Heat" to the tune of "Stayin' Alive."

Marcus: This is fascinating! Could you elaborate on how these musical alerts affect your cooking process? Are they helpful or distracting?

Luna: Mostly helpful, though I had to disable the "Chop Chop" rap feature during vegetable prep. It kept trying to match my knife rhythm and turned my carrot-cutting into an impromptu beatboxing session.

Professor Whimsy: *stroking chin thoughtfully* Indeed, the rhythm-matching algorithm needs work. Last week, my unit detected my heartbeat while I was making risotto and turned the entire process into a waltz. "Stir, two, three... Stir, two, three..." For thirty minutes!

Sarah: That's interesting! Dev, you mentioned earlier you work in a professional kitchen. How does the SingingSous™ handle high-pressure environments?

Dev: *chuckling* Well, during rush hour last Friday, all six units in our kitchen synchronized into a spontaneous performance of "Under Pressure." The weird part was, it actually helped coordinate our timing! Though we did have to ask them to stop doing kick-lines with their cabinet doors.

Luna: The customization options are both amazing and terrifying. I set mine to "Broadway Mode" and now it does a full "Les Misérables" style number when I'm running low on ingredients. Yesterday it sang "One Day More" when I was down to my last egg.

Professor Whimsy: *adjusting spectacles* The emotional range is quite remarkable. My unit somehow detected my breakup last month and started playing nothing but comfort food recipes to the tune of Adele songs. Though I could have done without the dramatic key change every time I opened the freezer for ice cream.

Sarah: Let's talk about the recipe assistant feature. How do you find the step-by-step musical instructions?

Dev: The good: it breaks down complex techniques into memorable tunes. The bad: I can't get "Whisk It Good" out of my head after making meringues.

Luna: Oh! And don't forget about the duet feature! When my friend brought over her unit, they performed "Anything You Can Bake, I Can Bake Better." It was hilarious until they actually started a bake-off using our ingredients.

Professor Whimsy: *excitedly* The temperature alerts are quite clever too. Though perhaps "Ring of Fire" wasn't the most reassuring choice for indicating a preheated oven.

Marcus: How about the voice recognition? Any issues there?

Dev: Well... *laughing* It has trouble with accents. When my Italian grandmother asked for a pizza recipe, it started performing "That's Amore" while displaying instructions for making tacos.

Luna: Better than mine! I sneezed while asking for soup recipes and it gave me a three-act opera about the history of tissues.

Sarah: What about the emergency features?

Professor Whimsy: Extremely effective! When I nearly left a pot boiling over, it performed a perfect rendition of "Great Balls of Fire" while flashing its lights in morse code. Though the neighbors called the fire department when it followed up with "Disco Inferno."

Luna: The timer features are fun too! Instead of just beeping, it counts down the last ten seconds like a game show host. Mine does the "Final Jeopardy" theme for everything.

Dev: *nodding* The holiday modes are something else. Last Christmas, all the appliances in my kitchen coordinated a production of "The Nutcracker" using steam releases for dramatic effect.

Sarah: Speaking of coordination, how does it handle multiple dishes?

Professor Whimsy: *adjusting bow tie again* Remarkably well, actually! Though its version of "I'm a Little Teapot" gets progressively more stressed as you add more tasks. By the time I was preparing a five-course meal, it was practically doing an anxiety-fueled rap battle with the refrigerator.

Luna: The food storage alerts are helpful, if a bit dramatic. Mine serenades forgotten leftovers with "Memory" from Cats.

Dev: And don't get me started on the grocery list feature! It creates a shopping list by composing a parody of "I Will Survive" about your empty pantry.

Marcus: This is all incredibly helpful feedback. Any final thoughts?

Professor Whimsy: Perhaps tone down the dramatic finales? My unit insists on ending every successful recipe with a full chorus line of animated utensils.

Luna: And maybe add a volume control for late-night cooking? My neighbors are tired of hearing "Midnight Snack Attack" at 2 AM.

Dev: Overall though, it's revolutionary! Just... maybe reconsider the "Don't Stop Believin'" motivation song when recipes go wrong?

Sarah: This has been incredibly insightful, thank you all! *sound of multiple appliances humming the goodbye theme from The Sound of Music*

Marcus: Before we wrap up, if there was one feature that could really help you, what would it be?

Luna: Honestly, a feature that could sync with my calendar and suggest meals based on my schedule would be a game-changer. Sometimes I just need a little nudge in the right direction.
